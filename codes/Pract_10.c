//Write a C program (name it "filecopy. c")  that copies the contents of one file to a destination file. 
//This program will read data from one file and copy them to another. 
//The first input that the program will need is the names of the two files: input file ("input.txt") and output file ("output.txt"). 
//Once the two file names have been obtained, the program must open the input file and create and open the output file.
